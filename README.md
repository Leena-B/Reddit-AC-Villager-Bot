# Reddit Notification Bot for r/ACVillager

<h5> What does this bot do? </h5>
This bot i utilizes Reddit's API to send me a personal reddit message when there is a submission on r/ACVillager. 

<h4> Improvements needed: <h4>
Currently, the bot is functional and sends a message when the program is run. 
  TODO:
  - seach for multiple villagers and filter based on payment wanted
  - use Python time module to have bot check for new posts every few minutes
  - use a Raspberry Pi to have the bot run 24/7
